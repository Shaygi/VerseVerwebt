# WovenVerses

Woven verses is a unique puzzle game that interacts with your phone's control center and sensors. The game is styled as a book and includes seven chapters, each featuring its own puzzle, as well as an introductory puzzle. Players can log in or register, and by solving puzzles, they can generate a high score that is displayed on a leaderboard. The total time taken to solve each chapter is added up to form the final score.

## Features

Log in/Register: Players can create an account or log in to track their progress.

Chapter Puzzles: Each of the seven chapters presents a unique puzzle that requires interaction with the phone's control center and sensors.

Leaderboard: The time taken to solve each puzzle is recorded, and the total time is displayed on a leaderboard.

Book-Style Design: The game is designed to resemble a book, enhancing the immersive experience.

## Getting started

To test the game using the Android Studio emulator, follow these steps:

- Use a Pixel 3a API 34 emulator for testing.
- In the emulator's advanced settings, set both the front and back camera emulation to "Emulated" to enable access to the flashlight in the control center.
- Add the dark theme button to the control center for quicker access during gameplay.
- In addition, the microphone must be activated in the microphone settings depending on the selected input.
- If the light (lux) value is below 200 in the visual sensor settings, this should be raised for the best gaming experience.
- If you do not see the button for the DarkTheme when opening the control center, you must add it via the Edit Tool to facilitate access during the game.

No additional installations are required.
